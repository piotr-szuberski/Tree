# Tree
Badly written program in C (first time splitting the files into headers and linking them) on the beginning of the 2nd semester

The purpose of this excercise was to implement the data structure and mainly to write automated tests that redirected input and output to /dev/null and compared the output from stderr and stdout in bash and makefile without using CMake.
