# Tree
Badly written program in C (first time splitting the files into headers and linking them) on the beginning of the 2nd semester

The main objective of this task was to write a script that performs automated tests and (minorly) makefile without using CMake

Usage:
make all
./test.sh ./solution ./tests
make clean

or make debug
./test.sh -v ./solution ./tests
make clean
